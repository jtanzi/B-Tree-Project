*******HW5 ReadMe*********

The B+ Tree program is written in C++ and consists of the following files:

main.cpp
Tree.h
Tree.cpp
Node.h
Node.cpp

main.cpp is the main component that drives the program.  There are two classes used in the program, Tree and Node.  The Tree.h and Tree.cpp files are the header and class definintion files for the Tree class, and likewise the Node.h and Node.cpp files are the header and definition files for the Node class.  Both are referenced in the main.cpp program.  The program compiles to an executable named "hw5".

To compile the program (once extracted) just type in

make

To clean up the compiled code files and start fresh, enter

make clean

To run the program, enter

./hw5

Once the program is running, a "$" will be displayed as a command prompt.  The following commands may be entered at this point:

Insert <key> <value>
Inserts a new record with the key value of <key> and a value of <value>.  Both <key> and <value> must be integers.

Delete <key> <value>
Deletes a record with key of <key>.

Search <key>
Returns the value in the record at index <key> if <key> is found in the tree, otherwise it returns -1.

Output
Outputs the tree to the screen.  Null values are represented by having all digits of the field value be 9, so if SSN1 is null, it will be 999999999, likewise if a pointer is null, it will be 9999.

Exit (or exit)
Exits the program.
